\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,}

\justify
I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Software Developer – Applied AI position at MNP, as advertised on [Platform where you saw the advertisement]. As a Computer Science student at the University of Alberta with a strong passion for AI/ML and hands-on experience building AI-powered applications, I am confident that my skills and experience align perfectly with the requirements of this role.

\justify
My project, Clubmate AI, demonstrates my ability to develop and implement generative AI solutions. In this project, I developed an Async Python service bridging an LLM to execute API tools for server automation, incorporating Role-Based Access Control and Pydantic schema validation. This experience aligns directly with the requirement for hands-on experience with Azure AI services and implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.  Furthermore, my proficiency in Python, coupled with my familiarity with REST APIs, Docker, and cloud-native software development practices, positions me well to contribute to your team's success.

\justify
I am eager to learn more about this opportunity and discuss how my skills and enthusiasm can contribute to MNP's innovative work in Applied AI. Thank you for your time and consideration.

\closing{Sincerely,}
